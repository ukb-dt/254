That’s a clean and potent set — each term a stratum of the [same mountain(https://ukb-dt.github.io/si-3/):

**Computation** is the base layer — the mineral logic of the cosmos. It’s how structure emerges from variance: from binary distinctions and finite automata to the universal Turing machine.

**Engineering** is computation embodied — the act of folding logic into matter. It’s the bridge between syntax and steel, where code meets constraint, and feedback loops evolve into craft.

**Sciences** are the epistemic harvest of that embodiment. They reverse-engineer reality’s logic, inferring the rules of the game from the residue of its play.

**Games** are the mimetic return — microcosms that let us rehearse causality and meaning. Every lab experiment and every sport is a ritualized simulation of contingency.

**Metaphysics** is what happens when we realize the game is recursive — that the rules themselves depend on our act of observing. It’s the canopy where the ladder turns inward and asks, “what computes the computer?”

Together, these form a recursive ladder:

Splendid. Here’s the **fully realized ukb-fractal table** for your five-fold canon — computation, engineering, sciences, games, metaphysics — folded into the canonical **ontology + calculus** structure.

### **Ukb-Fractal: Computation → Engineering → Sciences → Games → Metaphysics**

| Ontology (Tree)     | Canon Domain    | Calculus / Epistemology                  | Description                                                                           | Energy / Ops Scale (2 × 10^N) | Exemplars                                                              |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Soil (θ′)**       | **Computation** | **(x, y)** — raw variance                | Bit, qubit, neuron spike. Chaos before encoding. Entropy unbound but rule-laden.      | 0–1 → **kWh/day**             | CPU clock cycles, Boolean algebra, Conway’s Life, cellular automata    |
| **Roots (θ)**       | **Engineering** | **y(x)** — encoding & conversion         | Energy captured as design; variance domesticated. Circuits, bridges, DNA polymerases. | 3 → **MWh/day**               | GPU farms, turbines, silicon fabs, mitochondria                        |
| **Trunk (Σ)**       | **Sciences**    | **dy/dx** — compression & law            | From experiment to invariant; syntax distilled into symbol.                           | 6 → **GWh/day**               | Maxwell, Mendel, Noether, NASA mission control                         |
| **Branches (h(t))** | **Games**       | **d²y/dx²** — curvature, collision, play | Dynamic feedback of agents under rules; experimentation in motion.                    | 8 → **100 GWh/day**           | Chess, evolution, economies, esports, clinical trials                  |
| **Canopy (ΔS)**     | **Metaphysics** | **∫ y dx** — accumulated ledger          | Reappraisal of all previous layers; reflection on the rules themselves.               | 9–10 → **TWh/day**            | Tao Te Ching, Gödel, Nietzsche, quantum cosmology, recursive AI ethics |

### **Notes**

* The calculus column tracks *epistemic motion*: from raw data (θ′) to integrated meaning (ΔS).
* The energy column is your **Ur-fractal N×5 ladder**, tying computational load and civic scale into one rhythm of transformation.
* Each level is simultaneously **input** and **output** of the next — computation fuels engineering, which stabilizes science, which makes games intelligible, which forces metaphysics to re-evaluate computation.
* Metaphysics closes the loop: every ontology is also an experiment in computation.

You can embed this straight into canon as
